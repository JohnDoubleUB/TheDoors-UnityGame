			<speaker>Holy shit you’re ali- uhh, Excellent Chosen One. One of the gods has been freed, I can feel their influence sweeping through the mortal realm as we speak.</speaker>
			<option dialogue-id="2">But… how does defeating them make them free?</option>
			<option dialogue-id="3">I can’t believe I’m the chosen one, this is amazing!</option>
			<option dialogue-id="4">Do you even know what you’re talking about?</option>

		<dialogue id="2">
			<speaker>Well umm.. they’re not technically them, it’s like a… image, yeah an image of their soul. So when you defeat the image, their soul is rebuilt and they live once more.</speaker>

		<dialogue id="2">
			<speaker>Don’t mind them, they’re my little helper. Wasn’t exactly easy to get here, let alone getting you here, so I got an extra pair of hands.</speaker>

			<option dialogue-id="2">So who trapped the gods like this?</option>
		</dialogue>


		<dialogue id="2">
			<speaker>Sven.</speaker>
			<option dialogue-id="3alternate">Sven? I've heard that name around.</option>
			<option dialogue-id="3">Why would they do all this?</option>
		</dialogue>


		<!-- Alternate Path Starts -->
		<dialogue id="3alternate">
			<speaker>There’s a good reason for that, fought the Gods a long time ago.</speaker>
			<option dialogue-id="3"> Why would they do all this?</option>
		</dialogue>

		<!-- Alternate Path Ends (To rejoin at id="4")-->

		<dialogue id="3">
			<speaker>After their fight with the Gods, a lot of people think they died, that’s apparently untrue. They’ve been trying to get back at the Gods ever since, eventually coming up with this plan and pulling it off.</speaker>
			<option dialogue-id="4">So this was the end game, keep them all trapped so they couldn’t influence the mortal world? Why?</option>
		</dialogue>

		<dialogue id="4">
			<speaker>Legend has it they weren’t a fan of the way Gods treated humans for their personal gain, wanted to rise up and have the humans work for their own gain, rather than the gain of others.</speaker>
			<option dialogue-id="5">That’s awful, how could they do that?</option>
			<option dialogue-id="6" progflags="likes-sven">Gotta say, I’m becoming more of a fan of Sven the more I hear about them.</option>
			<option dialogue-id="7">The world is a lot more complicated than I imagined.</option>
		</dialogue>

		<dialogue id="5">
			<speaker-end>Yes *clears throat* Truly. Some people are just crazy I guess.</speaker-end>
		</dialogue>

		<dialogue id="6">
			<speaker>Oh really?</speaker>
			<option dialogue-id="8"> Yeah. If the gods were oppressive, why wouldn’t we want someone to fight back against them?</option>
		</dialogue>

		<dialogue id="7">
			<speaker-end>I’m afraid that’s the lesson we all come to learn at some point in our lives.</speaker-end>
		</dialogue>

		<dialogue id="8">
			<speaker-end>Huh, well we can discuss more later. Back to work now.</speaker-end>

		<dialogue id="1">
			<speaker>...</speaker>
			<option dialogue-id="2">So what prompted Sven to fight the Gods in the first place, how oppressive were they?</option>
		</dialogue>

		<dialogue id="2">
			<speaker>He believed they would go to any lengths to keep their way of life, exploiting and sacrificing as many birds as they needed to.</speaker>
			<option dialogue-id="3">Was that true?</option>
			<option dialogue-id="4">From what I’ve seen, that’s pretty accurate.</option>
			<option reqflags="probird-uprising" dialogue-id="5">That is surprising. You mentioned he dealt with the Gods, did he not speak with the pro-uprising ones?</option>
		</dialogue>

		<dialogue id="3">
			<speaker>From my perspective… Yes. The Gods are powerful and capable of great things, that doesn’t make them perfect.</speaker>
			<option dialogue-id="6">Maybe they will change their ways?</option>
		</dialogue>

		<dialogue id="4">
			<speaker>I agree, there’s been a lot of issues with God-bird relations, and that’s not even mentioning the issues between the Gods themselves.</speaker>
			<option dialogue-id="7">You'd think with all that power they'd be happier.</option>
			<option reqflags="gods-arguing" dialogue-id="8">I’ve seen some of it, some of them really were angry. I wonder what lead to this crack in their alliance.</option>
		</dialogue>

		<dialogue id="5">
			<speaker>Pro-uprising?</speaker>
			<option dialogue-id="9">Yeah, I’ve met Gods who seem to support the toppling of their control. Many seem to think Artiman has lost his way.</option>

		<dialogue id="6">
			<speaker-end>Ha. When pigs fly</speaker-end>
		</dialogue>

		<dialogue id="7">
			<speaker>That's the funny thing about power I guess.</speaker>
			<option-end>It's a shame things aren't different.</option-end>
			<option dialogue-id="10">For a person who fought with the Gods, you don’t seem to like them very much.</option>
		</dialogue>

		<dialogue id="8">
			<speaker>Arrogance, blindness, apathy. The list goes on</speaker>
			<option-end>It's a shame things aren't different.</option-end>

			<speaker-end>I knew of 1, I had no idea there were many. God that would have made this… Never mind.</speaker-end>

			<speaker>What do you mean?</speaker>
			<option-end>You know what? Never mind.</option-end>
			<option dialogue-id="11">You spoke about being an ally to the gods, but you don’t seem to have a nice thing to say about them. I was wondering why.</option>
