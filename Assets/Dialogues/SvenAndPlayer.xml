		<!-- Alternate Path Ends (To rejoin at id="4")-->

		<dialogue id="3">
			<speaker>After their fight with the Gods, a lot of people think they died, that’s apparently untrue. They’ve been trying to get back at the Gods ever since, eventually coming up with this plan and pulling it off.</speaker>
			<option dialogue-id="4">So this was the end game, keep them all trapped so they couldn’t influence the mortal world? Why?</option>
		</dialogue>

		<dialogue id="4">
			<speaker>Legend has it they weren’t a fan of the way Gods treated humans for their personal gain, wanted to rise up and have the humans work for their own gain, rather than the gain of others.</speaker>
			<option dialogue-id="5">That’s awful, how could they do that?</option>
			<option dialogue-id="6" progflags="likes-sven">Gotta say, I’m becoming more of a fan of Sven the more I hear about them.</option>

			<speaker-end>Yes *clears throat* Truly. Some people are just crazy I guess.</speaker-end>
		</dialogue>

		<dialogue id="6">
			<speaker>Oh really?</speaker>
			<option dialogue-id="8"> Yeah. If the gods were oppressive, why wouldn’t we want someone to fight back against them?</option>

			<speaker>He believed they would go to any lengths to keep their way of life, exploiting and sacrificing as many birds as they needed to.</speaker>
